# Python_Challange
## PyBank
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company. You will be given two sets of revenue data (budget_data_1.csv and budget_data_2.csv). Each dataset is composed of two columns: Date and Revenue. (Thankfully, your company has rather lax standards for accounting so the records are simple.)

Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The total amount of revenue gained over the entire period

    The average change in revenue between months over the entire period

    The greatest increase in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in revenue (date and amount) over the entire period

## PyParagraph
In this challenge, you get to play the role of chief linguist at a local learning academy. As chief linguist, you are responsible for assessing the complexity of various passages of writing, ranging from the sophomoric Twilight novel to the nauseatingly high-minded research article. Having read so many passages, you've since come up with a fairly simple set of metrics for assessing complexity.

Your task is to create a Python script to automate the analysis of any such passage using these metrics. Your script will need to do the following:

    Import a text file filled with a paragraph of your choosing.

    Assess the passage for each of the following:
        Approximate word count
        Approximate sentence count
        Approximate letter count (per word)
        Average sentence length (in words)
